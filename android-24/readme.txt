framework.jar file was combined with android.jar from /<SDK location>/platforms/android-X, where X is current API level.

I'm not sure that it will work as intended. If this does not work, please report to us.

========== BACKUP ==========

Original android.jar can be downloaded here
http://dl.google.com/android/repository/platform-24_r02.zip

Extract the archive and find android.jar
